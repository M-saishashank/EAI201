Enter total junctions and total connections: 5 6
Now provide each connection as: <from> <to> <flow cost>
0 1 2
0 2 4
1 2 1
1 3 7
2 4 3
3 4 1

Start junction: 0
Target junction: 4

Set depth for limited DFS: 3
Set max depth for iterative search: 4
>> ROUTING RESULTS <<
BFS (no cost considered): [0, 1, 2, 4]
DFS (no cost considered): [0, 1, 2, 4]
Depth-Limited Search: [0, 1, 2, 4]
Iterative Deepening: [0, 1, 2, 4]
Uniform Cost Search: Path → [0, 1, 2, 4] | Total Cost → 6
